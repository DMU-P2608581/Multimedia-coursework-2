  <p>The main symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) are:</p>
<p> a high temperature – this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back (you do not need to measure your temperature) </p>
<p> a new, continuous cough – this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or 3 or more coughing episodes in 24 hours (if you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual)</p>
<p> a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste – this means you've noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste different to normal </p>
<p> If you have any of these symptoms, get a test to check if you have coronavirus and stay at home until you get your result. </p>
